This is the extremely simple table that one can use to host the data from the YBs.
To get the page up and running, you will need to follow the instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch
You only need to follow the instructions for publishing from a branch, which should take around 5 minutes.
From there you can click on the 'Actions' tab where you can see the website being deployed (should take around 10 mins).
And finally your website should be available at astrodevine.github.io

For updating the page with the new data, simply make sure that any new csv files all have the YB, l, and b columns and you can replace the tables individually. If you want to add a table go through the code and each section that talks about tables or is repeated 4x references a table. Simply add a 5th through copy and pasting.
